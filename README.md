## Problem Statement: How can we improve the consistency and quality of place data over time by developing heuristics that detect and resolve conflicting or incomplete attributes across similar entities?

### Objective: Improve quality of place data over time by using heuristics to resolve conflicting or incomplete attributes across similar entities.

#### Key Result: Define 5 heuristics that help assess entity trust or stability (e.g., age, edit frequency, source reliability), to support long-term maintenance.

#### Key Result: Build 2 tools to go through database and ensure data quality using these heuristics. 

#### Key Result: Use these tools to clean 5 datasets.
